For the past three years, I’ve been running a series called “Books” that, once a year, would list the books that I found indispensable to read. This year, considering the changes that I went through from a workflow perspective, I thought it would be appropriate to start focusing on apps that I found indispensable on my computers as well.

I've included the iPhone apps because, like many others, I don’t use the “phone” part of the iPhone much. The iPhone is my portable computer. And I have lots of apps on it.

The list below includes my top picks for apps that I use several times every day and is organized in two sections: mobile and desktop.

#MOBILE APPS

- Mailbox
- Feedly
- Alien Blue
- Messages
- Whatsapp
- Reminders
- Instagram
- Facebook
- Plex
- CodeHub
- Runkeeper
- Safari

# DESKTOP APPS

In collecting the apps for this year’s roundup, I decided to lay down some ground rules so that the series will be better organized in the future.

First, gone is the self-imposed limit of 25 apps: I will link to every app that I consider a “must-have” in my workflow. Second, to be named a “must-have”, an app must be used regularly on a daily or weekly basis. And last, apps from either the Mac App Store or a developer’s website can be mentioned in the roundup.

With that said, let’s dive in.

- Adobe Lightroom
- Flickr Uploadr
- GitHub
- Google Drive
- iMovie
- Plex Home Theater
- Safari
- TextMate
