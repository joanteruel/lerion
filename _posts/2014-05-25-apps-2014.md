For the past three years, I’ve been running a series called [*Books*] that, once a year, would list the books that I found indispensable to read. This year, considering the changes that I went through from a workflow perspective, I thought it would be appropriate to start focusing on apps that I found indispensable on my computers as well.

The list below includes my top picks for apps that I use several times every day and is organized in two sections: mobile and desktop apps.

#MOBILE APPS

I included only iOS apps because **the iPhone and the iPad are my portable computers**. I don’t use Android OS but also you will find most of these apps in the Play Store.

- Whatsapp. This app no need description
- Feedly. The best news aggregator
- Alien Blue. A reddit client
- Mailbox. The most fast mail processor that I used
- Reminders. The iOS task manager
- Instagram. A photo social network
- CodeHub. GitHub repositories manager
- Tapatalk. The app to follow multiple online communities
- Plex. The best streaming media player
- Runkeeper. An app to track all the fitness activity

# DESKTOP APPS

I just considered the apps I use daily or weekly. With that said, let’s dive in.

- Adobe Lightroom
- Autodesk Autocad / Inventor
- GitHub
- Google Drive
- iMovie
- Plex Home Theater
- Safari
- TextMate
- Adobe Photoshop
- Flickr Uploadr
