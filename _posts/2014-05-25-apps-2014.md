For the past three years, I’ve been running a series called “Books” that, once a year, would list the books that I found indispensable to read. This year, considering the changes that I went through from a workflow perspective, I thought it would be appropriate to start focusing on apps that I found indispensable on my computers as well.

I've included the iPhone apps because, like many others, I don’t use the “phone” part of the iPhone much. The iPhone is my portable computer. And I have lots of apps on it.

The list below includes my top picks for apps that I use several times every day and is organized in two sections: mobile and desktop.

#MOBILE APPS

* Mailbox
* Feedly
* Alien Blue
* Messages
* Whatsapp
* Reminders
* Instagram
* Facebook
* Plex
* CodeHub
* Runkeeper
* Safari

# DESKTOP APPS

* Adobe Lightroom
* Flickr Uploadr
* GitHub
* Google Drive
* iMovie
* Plex Home Theater
* Safari
* TextMate
