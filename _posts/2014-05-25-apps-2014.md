For the past three years, I’ve been running a series called *Books* that, once a year, would list the books that I found indispensable to read. This year, considering the changes that I went through from a workflow perspective, I thought it would be appropriate to start focusing on apps that I found indispensable on my computers as well.

The list below includes my top picks for apps that I use several times every day and is organized in two sections: mobile and desktop apps.

#MOBILE APPS

I included only *iOS apps* because **the iPhone and the iPad are my portable computers**. I don’t use *Android OS* but also you will find most of these apps in the *Play Store*.

- Mailbox
- Feedly
- Alien Blue
- Messages
- Whatsapp
- Reminders
- Instagram
- Facebook
- Plex
- CodeHub
- Runkeeper
- Safari

# DESKTOP APPS

I just considered the apps I use daily or weekly. With that said, let’s dive in.

- Adobe Lightroom
- Flickr Uploadr
- GitHub
- Google Drive
- iMovie
- Plex Home Theater
- Safari
- TextMate
