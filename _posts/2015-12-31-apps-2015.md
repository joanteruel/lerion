The list below includes my top year picks for apps that I use several times every day organized in two sections: mobile and desktop apps.

#MOBILE APPS

I included only iOS apps because **the iPhone and the iPad are my portable computers**. I don’t use Android OS but also you will find most of these apps in the Play Store.

1. **Whatsapp**. This app doesn't need description
2. **Alien Blue**. A reddit client
3. **Mail**. The iOS mail processor
4. **Outlook**. Another mail processor I used only for work
5. **OneNote**. The Microsoft notes manager
6. **Instagram**. A photo social network
7. **Activity**. The iOS app to track all the fitness activity
7. **Intervals**. An app to track the intervals during fitness workout

# DESKTOP APPS

I just considered the apps I use daily or weekly. With that said, let’s dive in.

1. **OneDrive**. This app doesn't need description neither
2. **Safari**. The Apple web browser
3. **TextMate**. The killer text editor for writing code
4. **Eve Online**. Is a player-driven, persistent-world MMORPG set in a science fiction space
