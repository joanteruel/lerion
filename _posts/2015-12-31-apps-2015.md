The list below includes my top year picks for apps that I use several times every day organized in two sections: mobile and desktop apps.

#MOBILE APPS

I included only iOS apps because **the iPhone and the iPad are my portable computers**. I don’t use Android OS but also you will find most of these apps in the Play Store.

- **Whatsapp**. This app doesn't need description
- **Alien Blue**. A reddit client
- **Mail**. The iOS mail processor
- **Outlook**. Another mail processor I used only for work
- **OneNote**. The Microsoft notes manager
- **Instagram**. A photo social network
- **Activity**. The iOS app to track all the fitness activity
- **Intervals**. An app to track the intervals during fitness workout

# DESKTOP APPS

I just considered the apps I use daily or weekly. With that said, let’s dive in.

- **OneDrive**. This app doesn't need description neither
- **Safari**. The Apple web browser
- **TextMate**. The killer text editor for writing code
- **Eve Online**. Is a player-driven, persistent-world MMORPG set in a science fiction space
