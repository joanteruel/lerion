For some time now I’ve been  hearing fellow dweebs sing the praises of Jekyll, a static HTML generator built in Ruby. There’s clearly lots to love in Jekyll for the programmer-blogger.  
<br />
Creating your own HTML layouts is simple as Jekyll mostly stays out of your way (compare to customizing a Wordpress layout, for instance). It’s well-suited towards putting your entire blog, posts and all, into source control. The output is just static HTML, so you can deploy to just about any web server known to man.
